# Sentinel-Swarm

Deterministic multi-agent swarm simulation built on the Sentinel simulation core.

This project demonstrates:
- Deterministic multi-agent state updates
- Fixed-step simulation
- Replay and rollback safety
- Formation and neighborhood-based behavior

The purpose of this repository is to apply the Sentinel core to an
autonomous swarm-style problem domain (e.g. drones or agents).

This repository is intentionally scoped as a **demo application**, not an engine.
